        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>A standard pickleball court is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide. It looks very similar to a tennis court, but with a net that is 6 inches shorter. Don't worry about purchasing your own portable net; public pickleball courts can be found in many different places with increasing frequency as the sport continues to grow in popularity.</p>
        <p>To play pickleball, you need a paddle and a ball. It's recommended to purchase several balls at a time because they can break after some hours of use. Pickleball paddles and balls can easily be found online on sites like Amazon or at sporting goods stores. There are a variety of brands that sell affordable and reliable equipment, including Joola, Franklin, and Selkirk.</p>

        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>The USAPA (United States of America Pickleball Association) rulebook is fairly lengthy, but here we're only going to be concerned with the basics of the game. We won't worry about detailing the rules of doubles because the scoring is somewhat more complex than in singles. Pickleball's rules are very similar to the rules of tennis, except as detailed below:</p>
        <p>Pickleball is played to 11 points. Only the person who is currently serving may score points. When the server loses a rally, the other person gets to serve.</p>
        <p>The serve must be an underhand serve and must be made diagonally to the opposite quadrant on the opponent's side of the court. If the ball doesn't land inside that quadrant, the server loses the rally.</p>
        <p>On each side of the court, there is a line 7 feet from the net. The area between the line and the net is colloquially called "the kitchen." A player isn't allowed to hit the ball from inside the kitchen unless the ball has landed in the kitchen. This creates a new level of strategy because nobody can straddle the net as in tennis.</p>
        <p>During each rally, the ball must bounce on the court twice before it can be vollied (hit out of the air before bouncing on the court).

        <article>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Congratulations! You now know the basics of pickleball. See you on the courts!</p>
